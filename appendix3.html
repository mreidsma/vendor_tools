	<h2>JavaScript &amp; jQuery Tutorials</h2>

	<p>The web is full of great places to learn more about JavaScript and jQuery. Here are some sites I recommend (and some notes on why I <em>don't</em> recommend others.)</p>

	<h3>Recommended</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://thatandromeda.github.io/courseware/Intro-via-jQuery/intro.html">Introduction to Programming Concepts via jQuery</a>. Andromeda Yelton's wonderful and clear introduction to writing code using jQuery examples. Start here.</li>
		<li><a href="https://codeacademy.com">Code Academy</a>. Good self-paced tutorials for both JavaScript and jQuery. You can even build a JavaScript game!</li>
		<li><a href="http://learn-js.org/">Learn JS</a>. An online, interactive tutorial.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Watch Out For!</h3>

	<p>If you Google an issue you are having with JavaScript, you are bound to see links to the site W3 Schools (w3schools.com). The name makes it sound like the site is affiliated with the W3C, the parent organization for the web. However, there is no relationship at all. I've found outdated and incorrect information on w3schools sites, so I recommend you avoid it. Look on <a href="http://stackexchange.com">Stack Exchange</a> instead to get details about JavaScript methods or properties.</p>
